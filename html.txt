Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?
 The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a data communications protocol and acts as the foundation of the World Wide Web.
 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
 HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
 The HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 protocol conversion happens automatically and its backward compatible. 
 So there is nothing pretty much to be done to switch it other than ensuring your server supports it.
