Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript
 These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
 Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently. 
 One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the object’s properties and their corresponding values. 
 This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
